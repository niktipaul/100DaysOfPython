# INTERACTIVE ASSIGNMENT 01

# Instructions
# You are going to write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.
# e.g. student_heights = [180, 124, 165, 173, 189, 169, 146]

# The average height can be calculated by adding all the heights together and dividing by the total number of heights.

# e.g.
# 180 + 124 + 165 + 173 + 189 + 169 + 146 = 1146
# There are a total of 7 heights in student_heights
# 1146 ÷ 7 = 163.71428571428572

# Average height rounded to the nearest whole number = 164
# Important You should not use the sum() or len() functions in your answer. You should try to replicate their functionality using what you have learnt about for loops.

# Example Input
# 156 178 165 171 187
# In this case, student_heights would be a list that looks like: [156, 178, 165, 171, 187]

# Example Output
# 171

student_height = input("Enter the list of students: ").split()

for i in range(len(student_height)):
    student_height[i] = int(student_height[i])

sum_ = 0
count = 0

for height in student_height:
    sum_ += height
    count += 1

print("Average Height = ",round(sum_/count))
